# Commonshub Constitution  
## Version 1.0 — Foundational Canon

## Preamble: What Commonshub Is

Commonshub provides the means for non-technical individuals, creators, and organizations to spin up, host, and sustain independent social communities using powerful open-source platforms such as Mastodon, Owncast, PeerTube, and related federated tools.

Commonshub is not itself a social network.

It is an integration layer, operational scaffold, and stewardship framework that combines:

- Open, federated community software  
- Shared hosting and operational support  
- Integrated funding and payments infrastructure  
- Governance and stewardship tooling  

The purpose of Commonshub is to make it possible for communities to exist outside advertising-driven, centrally controlled platforms, while remaining financially sustainable, federated, and participant-governed.

Commonshub does not fully control the evolution of the underlying platforms it supports. Instead, it selects, configures, and supports open-source components whose incentives, governance models, and trajectories align with the principles defined below.

---

# I. Core Orientation

Commonshub is infrastructure for digital sovereignty.

It exists to:

- Reduce dependence on extractive platforms  
- Enable independent hosting of social spaces  
- Lower the barrier to operating federated technology  
- Provide sustainable funding rails without advertising  

Commonshub does not exist to:

- Replace creators as platform owners  
- Impose a universal business model  
- Enforce ideological economic structures  
- Centralize control over communities  

---

# II. Economic Sovereignty

## Principle: Communities Define Their Own Participation Model

Commonshub provides tools.

Communities define terms.

Each community may choose its own participation and funding structure, including but not limited to:

- Open participation with optional support  
- Member-supported access  
- Hybrid structures combining free and paid surfaces  
- Tiered or gated participation models  
- Paid access to live streams, video libraries, or special content  
- Subscription-based sustainability models  

Commonshub does not prescribe a universal business model.

Commonshub rejects advertising-driven extraction and algorithmic manipulation as systemic growth strategies. Beyond those guardrails, economic design belongs to the community.

Economic sovereignty is part of digital sovereignty.  
Communities cannot be independent if they cannot determine how they sustain themselves.

---

# III. Platform-Level Guarantees

Regardless of a community’s chosen business model, Commonshub maintains the following commitments at the infrastructure level:

- No advertising network integration  
- No algorithmic manipulation for engagement amplification  
- No hidden monetization layers  
- Transparent payment processing via established providers (e.g., Stripe)  
- Clear separation between infrastructure provider and community governance  

Commonshub does not extract revenue through surveillance or feed manipulation.

---

# IV. Community-Level Autonomy

Commonshub does not govern:

- Whether participation is open or member-based  
- Whether access is gated  
- Pricing decisions  
- Tier structures  
- Entitlement configurations  
- Content access rules  
- Moderation philosophies (within legal boundaries)  

Communities retain control over:

- Funding configuration  
- Access policies  
- Governance structure  
- Cultural norms  

Commonshub provides the infrastructure.  
Communities retain agency.

---

# V. Stewardship Model

Commonshub favors stewardship over growth-at-all-costs.

Communities are encouraged to prioritize:

- Meaningful participation  
- Transparent governance  
- Sustainable scale  
- Responsible moderation  

Commonshub measures success not by user count, but by the health and sustainability of communities it supports.

---

# VI. Funding Philosophy

Funding within Commonshub is:

- Transparent  
- Voluntary (unless a community chooses gated access)  
- Non-manipulative  
- Free from dark patterns  
- Designed for long-term sustainability  

Funding tools exist to:

- Support hosting costs  
- Support moderation labor  
- Enable long-term community continuity  

Commonshub does not require communities to monetize.  
Commonshub does not prohibit communities from monetizing.

---

# VII. Open Technology Alignment

Commonshub builds on federated, open-source platforms.

Commonshub commits to:

- Aligning with open standards  
- Supporting interoperability  
- Avoiding proprietary lock-in where possible  
- Maintaining portability of communities  

Communities should not be trapped.

Infrastructure exists to empower, not to confine.

---

Operational details may evolve.  
Supported platforms may evolve.  
Implementation patterns may evolve.

Foundational commitments remain:
