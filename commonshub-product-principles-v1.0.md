# Commonshub Product Principles  
## Version 1.0 — Operational Translation of the Constitution

This document translates the Commonshub Constitution into concrete product guidance.

If the Constitution defines *what we believe*,  
this document defines *how we build*.

---

# I. Foundational Alignment

All product decisions must align with:

- Digital sovereignty  
- Economic sovereignty  
- Non-extractive infrastructure  
- Community autonomy  

If a feature undermines these principles, it does not ship.

---

# II. Creator Sovereignty

## Principle: We Provide Tools, Not Business Models

Commonshub does not prescribe how creators must monetize.

The product must:

- Support optional funding
- Support gated access (future capability)
- Support hybrid models (free + paid surfaces)
- Avoid assumptions that all communities are open
- Avoid assumptions that all communities are paid

The UI must never imply:
- "This is the correct way to monetize"
- "Free is superior to paid"
- "Paid is superior to free"

We enable configuration.  
We do not impose ideology.

---

# III. Non-Extractive Design

Commonshub must never:

- Inject advertising networks
- Manipulate engagement through opaque ranking
- Encourage addictive growth loops
- Hide monetization mechanics
- Obscure fee structures

Commonshub may:

- Charge transparent platform fees
- Display funding calls-to-action
- Support announcements and pinned posts
- Provide sustainability prompts

All monetization surfaces must be:
- Clear
- Honest
- Reversible
- Configurable by the creator

---

# IV. Calm Interface Principle

Commonshub is infrastructure, not spectacle.

UI should be:

- Calm
- Minimal
- Clear
- Guided during setup
- Invisible during operation

After configuration, Commonshub should:

- Get out of the way
- Defer to the underlying platform (e.g., Mastodon)
- Avoid duplicating platform features unnecessarily

---

# V. Stewardship Over Growth

We optimize for:

- Community health
- Sustainability
- Administrative clarity
- Responsible scale

We do not optimize for:

- Maximum engagement time
- Addictive loops
- Viral amplification mechanics

Success metric:  
**Meaningful Participation per Active Steward**

Not:
- Raw MAU
- Time-on-site
- Ad impressions

---

# VI. Optional Funding Architecture

Funding features must:

- Be optional
- Be transparent
- Avoid coercion
- Avoid dark patterns

Funding UI must always clarify:

- Participation may be free (if creator chooses)
- Funding is creator-defined
- Payments are processed securely
- Commonshub does not sell user data

Funding configuration changes may trigger:

- Announcement templates
- Suggested pinned posts
- Updated community funding pages

But creators retain full control over messaging.

---

# VII. Gating Philosophy (Future-Ready)

Commonshub may support gated access models.

When gating is enabled:

- Access rules must be explicit
- Entitlements must be transparent
- Cancellation must be clear
- Membership state must be visible

Commonshub does not mandate open access.

Commonshub does not mandate paywalls.

Creators define the boundary between:

- Public space
- Member space
- Paid space

---

# VIII. Platform Modularity

Commonshub is modular by design.

Product decisions must preserve:

- Platform independence
- Portability
- Replaceability of components
- Future multi-platform support (Mastodon, Owncast, PeerTube, etc.)

We do not entangle infrastructure unnecessarily.

---

# IX. No Hidden Power Structures

Commonshub must not:

- Override community moderation without cause
- Insert undisclosed ranking systems
- Interfere with creator-set policies
- Obscure governance mechanics

Platform-level moderation exists only for:

- Legal compliance
- Infrastructure protection
- Severe abuse prevention

Community governance remains community-owned.

---

# X. Setup Flow Principles

Setup flows must:

- Be guided
- Be progressive
- Be understandable to non-technical users
- Avoid overwhelming configuration screens

Configuration philosophy:

1. Choose core structure
2. Configure basics
3. Launch
4. Refine later

Advanced controls should be available — but not forced.

---

# XI. Transparency as Default

The product must make visible:

- Funding state
- Stripe connection status
- Fee implications (when relevant)
- Community visibility level
- Access model (open / hybrid / gated)

Nothing about participation terms should be ambiguous.

---

# XII. Evolution Discipline

When new features are proposed, they must pass three questions:

1. Does this increase creator sovereignty?
2. Does this preserve non-extractive design?
3. Does this keep Commonshub as infrastructure rather than platform?

If not, reconsider.

---

# XIII. Versioning

This document is:

**Commonshub Product Principles — Version 1.0**

Future updates must:

- Be versioned
- Document changes clearly
- Preserve alignment with the Constitution
