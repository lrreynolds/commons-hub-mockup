# 1. Purpose

This document defines:

- How Commonshub speaks
- How funding is described
- How gating is described
- How sovereignty is framed
- What language is prohibited
- Copy patterns for key surfaces

This ensures consistency across:

- Website
- Dashboard
- Setup flow
- Funding pages
- Announcements
- Documentation
- Creator messaging templates

---

# 2. Core Tone Principles

Commonshub voice is:

- Calm
- Clear
- Non-salesy
- Non-extractive
- Non-performative
- Confident but understated
- Stewardship-oriented
- Creator-empowering

We do not sound like:

- A startup chasing growth
- A payment processor
- A marketing funnel
- A hype-driven SaaS tool

---

# 3. Voice Characteristics

## 3.1 Calm Authority

We state things plainly.

Instead of:
> “Unlock powerful monetization tools!”

We say:
> “Enable community funding.”

---

## 3.2 Optionality Emphasis

Funding is always framed as optional unless the creator explicitly gates.

Standard phrasing:

- “Participation is always free.”
- “Community funding is optional.”
- “Support this community if you’d like.”

---

## 3.3 Sovereignty Framing

We emphasize creator control.

Examples:

- “You control your funding model.”
- “You decide how your community operates.”
- “Commonshub provides the infrastructure. You provide the vision.”

---

## 3.4 Non-Extractive Language

We avoid:

- “Maximize revenue”
- “Monetize your audience”
- “Capture value”
- “Drive conversions”

We prefer:

- “Sustain your community”
- “Support ongoing work”
- “Help keep the space running”
- “Enable self-sustaining communities”

---

# 4. Funding Language Rules

## 4.1 Always Clarify Optionality (Default Model)

On funding pages:

Must include:
- “Participation is always free.”
- “Community funding is optional.”

Must not include:
- Implied obligation
- Scarcity tactics
- Urgency pressure

---

## 4.2 If Gated Mode (Future Feature)

Language must clearly state:

- “Access requires active membership.”
- “Membership is required to participate.”
- “Billing is handled by Stripe.”

No ambiguity.
No bait-and-switch.

---

# 5. Announcement Copy Pattern (MVP)

## Standard Three-Line Format

Support this community if you’d like.
Participation is always free. No ads.
Visit: https://example.community/funding

Rules:

- Max 3 lines preferred
- No emoji
- No hype
- No exclamation marks
- No marketing tone

---

# 6. Pinned Post Copy Pattern

Pinned post mirrors announcement.

Structure:

Short paragraph format:

If you’d like to support this community, you can here:
https://example.community/funding

Participation is always free.

Pinned posts may include:
- One additional sentence explaining purpose

But must remain short.

---

# 7. Funding Page Language Pattern

## Opening Section

Must include:

- Clear optionality statement
- Clear purpose of funding
- No marketing tone

Example:

> Participation is always free.  
> Community funding helps sustain the space for everyone.

---

## Payment Section

Tone:

- Neutral
- Clear
- Secure

Example:

> Payments are processed securely by Stripe.  
> Commonshub never sees your card details.

---

# 8. Dashboard Tone

Dashboard copy should feel:

- Administrative
- Calm
- Clear

Avoid:

- Excited language
- Promotional tone
- Emotional hooks

Examples:

Instead of:
> “Your community is crushing it!”

We say:
> “Your community is live.”

---

# 9. Setup Flow Tone

Setup flow should feel like:

- A guided journey
- A calm onboarding
- Not a funnel

Language pattern:

- “Next, we’ll help you…”
- “You can always change this later.”
- “This takes about 5 minutes.”

Avoid:

- “Optimize”
- “Boost”
- “Maximize”
- “Scale”

---

# 10. Creator-Facing Messaging

When speaking to creators:

Tone shifts slightly more empowering.

We may say:

- “You own this.”
- “You control your community.”
- “You decide how it works.”

But never:

- “You can monetize your followers.”
- “Turn your audience into income.”

---

# 11. Website Manifesto Tone

Website tone may be:

- Philosophical
- Anti-extractive
- Systems-aware
- Culture-focused

But product UI must remain calm and practical.

Separation rule:

Manifesto can be bold.
Dashboard must be stable.

---

# 12. Words to Avoid

Prohibited Terms (UI surfaces):

- Monetize
- Funnel
- Conversion
- Growth hacking
- Capture
- Leverage audience

- Optimize revenue
- Extract value

Allowed Terms:

---

# 13. Visual Language Alignment

Voice must match design:

- Soft contrast
- Spacious layout
- No aggressive CTAs
- No red urgency badges
- No countdowns
- No flashing indicators

---

# 14. Decision Rule

If a piece of copy makes the system feel:

- Like a SaaS growth machine → reject
- Like a calm infrastructure layer → accept
- Like a creator empowerment tool → accept

---

# 15. Alignment With Constitution

This document operationalizes:

- Creator sovereignty
- Non-extractive funding
- Optional participation
- Digital commons framing

This governs how we speak.
