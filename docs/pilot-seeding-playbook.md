Commonshub — Pilot Content Seeding Playbook (v1)

Purpose

Turn a newly configured community into a space that:
	•	feels alive
	•	feels safe to enter
	•	clearly demonstrates how it works

before the creator invites their audience.

This is not fake growth.

This is tone-setting and interaction modeling.

⸻

Core Principle

We are not creating “content.”

We are:

showing people how to behave in this space.

⸻

Target Outcome

When the creator first sees the demo:
	•	The feed is active
	•	The tone matches their show
	•	Conversations look intelligent and welcoming
	•	It already feels like their community

⸻

Time Budget

⏱ 45–60 minutes

⸻

1. Test Account Setup

Create 5–7 accounts.

Roles
	1.	Host account (real creator — or placeholder if not live yet)
	2.	Commonshub guide voice (optional, light presence)
	3.	Core community members (3–5)

These should look real:
	•	name
	•	avatar
	•	short bio
	•	1–2 prior posts

⸻

2. Follow Graph

Each test account follows:
	•	host
	•	show account
	•	2–3 others in the pilot

This creates:

✅ visible social fabric
✅ non-empty profiles
✅ realistic notifications later

⸻

3. The First Creator Post

This is the anchor for the entire space.

Structure
	•	welcome
	•	what this space is for
	•	how to participate

Example

Welcome — this is the new discussion space for the show.

This is where we continue the conversation between episodes:
deeper analysis, questions, sources, and respectful disagreement.

If you’ve been commenting on YouTube, start here:
introduce yourself and tell us what topics you want to go deeper on.

⸻

4. Core Seed Conversations

Create 3–5 high-signal posts from community accounts.

These should be:
	•	thoughtful
	•	specific
	•	on-topic for the show

Types

A. Episode reflection
“Two takeaways from the latest episode…”

B. Smart question
“What would change your assessment of X over the next 60 days?”

C. Resource share
“Best long-form analysis I’ve read this week…”

⸻

5. Model the Reply Pattern

Each seed post gets:

2–4 replies from different accounts.

This demonstrates:
	•	back-and-forth
	•	disagreement without hostility
	•	depth > volume

This is what converts observers into participants.

⸻

6. Host Lightweight Interaction (Optional)

If the real host is not yet active:

Use one single reply from the host account:
	•	appreciative
	•	short
	•	signal-boosting

Example:

Strong point on logistics — especially the rail constraints.

This shows:

✅ the host is present
❌ without creating reply pressure

⸻

7. Profile Pre-Population

Each test account should have:
	•	1 intro post
	•	1 topical post

So profiles don’t feel empty when clicked.

⸻

8. Hashtag Rhythm

Use the primary hashtag sparingly and consistently.

Not on every post.

This creates:
	•	discovery
	•	structure
	•	future creator workflow

⸻

9. What We DO NOT Do

🚫 No volume simulation
🚫 No fake “welcome floods”
🚫 No engagement bait
🚫 No episode-thread duplication

We are modeling quality and continuity, not scale.

⸻

10. Launch-Ready Signal Check

Before showing the creator:

Ask:
	•	Does the feed feel intelligent?
	•	Does it feel calm but active?
	•	Would a serious viewer post here?

If yes → demo ready.

⸻

Creator Experience Goal

When they see it:

They should immediately understand:

“Oh — this is where the real conversation lives.”

Not:

“I need to manage another comment section.”

⸻

Operational Sequence for Real Pilots

This happens in this exact order:
	1.	Configure server & branding
	2.	Apply identity & rules
	3.	Create test accounts
	4.	Seed conversation
	5.	QA the feed
	6.	Demo to creator

Only after approval:
	7.	Invite real founding members

⸻

Future Automation Targets (Do Not Build Yet)

This playbook will later map to:
	•	guided onboarding defaults
	•	auto-generated welcome posts
	•	starter follow packs
	•	conversation prompts

But for pilots:

This is manual craft — and that’s the advantage.

⸻

Definition of Success

The creator says:

“This is exactly the kind of discussion I want around the show.”

Not:

“How do I keep up with this?”
