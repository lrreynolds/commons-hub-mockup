This document should clearly walk through the full funding journey.

### Creator side
- How funding is enabled from the dashboard
- How Stripe Connect fits into the flow
- What state changes occur at each step
- How the pinned funding post / announcement is created

### Public side
- How the community funding page works as:
  - A funding surface
  - A community onboarding ramp
- How non-members are invited to join
- How messaging stays calm, optional, and non-extractive

For each step, describe:
- What the user sees
- What state changes
- Which system is responsible:
  - Commonshub
  - Mastodon
  - Stripe
- Where fallback to Mastodon UI may be required

This should read like a **clear walkthrough**, not a spec dump.

## 2. UI Sketches or Wireframes (Required)

Provide **rough UI sketches or wireframes** for the following screens:

### Internal (creator-facing)
- Dashboard state before funding is enabled
- Dashboard state after funding is enabled
- Funding explainer screen
- Stripe connect step (conceptual)

### Public (member-facing)
- Community funding landing page (funding + onboarding)
- Example pinned funding post or announcement

These can be:
- Simple wireframes
- Annotated screenshots
- Low-fidelity mockups

Polish is **not** required.  
Clarity and restraint **are** required.

We are explicitly looking at:
- Separation of internal vs public surfaces
- Taste and judgment
- How you avoid over-designing admin UI
- How you treat the public-facing page as a brand surface
