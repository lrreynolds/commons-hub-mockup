⚡ What YOU should request from creators (minimal version)

Your earlier instinct was correct — keep it ultra light.

Creator Asset Request (final)

Please send:
	1.	Community / show name
	2.	Desired subdomain
	3.	Square logo (or we will create one from your existing artwork)
	4.	Header / banner image (if you have one)
	5.	Short description (1–2 sentences)

That’s it.

Everything else = white-glove by you.

⸻

🧠 Internal: your reusable “instant launch kit”

You should maintain a fallback pack:

When creators send nothing, you can still launch a beautiful server.

Have ready:
	•	neutral high-quality header template
	•	neutral OpenGraph template
	•	system avatar
	•	default thumbnail

Swap:
	•	name
	•	logo
	•	description

→ launch in minutes.
