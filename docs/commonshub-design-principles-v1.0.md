Commonshub Design Principles

Version 1.0

⸻

1. Design Philosophy

Commonshub design must communicate:
	•	Calm
	•	Stewardship
	•	Legitimacy
	•	Sovereignty
	•	Non-extractive intent

We are not building a growth machine.
We are building infrastructure for digital commons.

Design must reflect that.

⸻

2. Core Experience Goals

Every surface should feel:
	•	Clear
	•	Grounded
	•	Unhurried
	•	Trustworthy
	•	Intentional

Nothing should feel:
	•	Gamified
	•	Urgent
	•	Manipulative
	•	Growth-hacked
	•	Addictive

⸻

3. Product Framing Rules

Commonshub is:
	•	A control plane
	•	A hosting layer
	•	A stewardship scaffold

Commonshub is not:
	•	A social feed
	•	An algorithm
	•	A content engine
	•	A promotional layer

Mastodon (or other federated software) remains the social surface.

⸻

4. Funding Design Rules

Funding must feel:
	•	Optional
	•	Transparent
	•	Contextual
	•	Respectful

Never:
	•	Required by default
	•	Hidden behind dark patterns
	•	Aggressive
	•	Emotionally manipulative

Language defaults:
	•	“Participation is always free.”
	•	“Community funding helps sustain the space.”
	•	“No ads. No tracking. No algorithms.”

⸻

5. Creator Sovereignty in UX

The interface must allow creators to:
	•	Choose their funding model
	•	Modify messaging
	•	Enable or disable announcements
	•	Change pinned posts
	•	Configure access rules (future)

Commonshub suggests best practices.
Commonshub does not enforce ideology.

⸻

6. Flow Design

Setup flows must feel:
	•	Guided but not coercive
	•	Short and purposeful
	•	Clear about outcomes
	•	Reversible

Rules:
	•	Always show where the user is.
	•	Always show what happens next.
	•	Always allow “Start over.”
	•	No hidden steps.

Flow mode should feel like a temporary focused journey — not a different product.

⸻

7. Visual System Guidelines

The visual system should be:
	•	Soft, neutral, grounded
	•	Low contrast in chrome
	•	High clarity in primary actions
	•	Minimal ornamentation

Avoid:
	•	Heavy gradients
	•	Bright alerts
	•	Excessive color shifts
	•	Loud success animations

Primary CTAs should feel confident.
Secondary actions should feel quiet but readable.

⸻

8. Announcements & Pinned Posts

When Commonshub generates suggested messaging:
	•	Keep it short.
	•	Keep it neutral.
	•	Avoid sales language.
	•	Avoid urgency.

Announcements should:
	•	Fit in 3–4 lines
	•	Be readable in Mastodon web
	•	Not overwhelm mobile UX

Pinned posts should:
	•	Be shorter than announcements
	•	Work in clients that hide announcements

⸻

9. Public Pages (Funding, Invite, Join)

Public surfaces must:
	•	Clearly state participation is free
	•	Clearly state funding is optional (unless gated mode enabled)
	•	Explain where payments go
	•	State Stripe handles payments
	•	Avoid technical jargon

Trust is built through clarity, not decoration.

⸻

10. Consistency Rules

If a decision is made in one place:
	•	It must be reflected everywhere.

Example:

If a creator enables funding:
	•	Announcement should update.
	•	Pinned post should update.
	•	Dashboard should update.
	•	Funding page must reflect it.

No stale messaging.

⸻

11. Mobile Reality Principle

Never assume:
	•	Announcements are visible everywhere.
	•	Mastodon UI is consistent.
	•	Third-party clients expose admin tools.

Design must:
	•	Support redundancy (announcement + pinned post).
	•	Assume partial visibility.
	•	Avoid reliance on a single surface.

⸻

12. Anti-Extraction Guardrails

Commonshub design must never:
	•	Introduce engagement metrics as primary signals
	•	Incentivize outrage
	•	Reward posting frequency
	•	Promote algorithmic feeds

We build durable spaces, not attention traps.

⸻

13. Design North Star

Commonshub should feel like:

A well-built public library for the internet —
not a shopping mall.
