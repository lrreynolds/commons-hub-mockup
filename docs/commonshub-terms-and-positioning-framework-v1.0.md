⸻

3. Core Positioning Statement

Commonshub empowers creators and organizations to launch, host, and sustain independent social communities using powerful open-source software — with optional, non-extractive funding mechanisms.

It enables ordinary people to build what previously required massive capital and centralized control.

4. Primary Narrative Pillars

4.1 Creator Sovereignty
	•	You control your community
	•	You set your rules
	•	You decide whether access is open or gated
	•	You choose your funding model
	•	You own your relationship with members

Commonshub does not dictate business models.

⸻

4.2 Infrastructure Stewardship
	•	Secure hosting
	•	Operational support
	•	Stripe integration
	•	Federated configuration
	•	Governance tooling

Commonshub handles complexity so creators can focus on community.

⸻

4.3 Optional Funding
	•	Participation is always free unless the creator chooses otherwise
	•	Funding is transparent
	•	No advertising
	•	No algorithmic amplification
	•	No extraction

Commonshub enables sustainability without manipulation.

⸻

4.4 Federation Over Centralization
	•	Built on Mastodon and other federated tools
	•	Communities are not locked into a single feed
	•	Power is distributed
	•	Interoperability is preserved

Commonshub selects aligned open-source components.

	•	Community Operator
	•	Steward

7. Gated Access Framing

If discussing gated communities:

Position as:
	•	A creator choice
	•	A business model option
	•	A sustainability mechanism

Not as:

	•	A moral position
	•	A platform mandate

We empower. We do not prescribe.

Instead emphasize:
	•	Ownership of infrastructure
	•	Federation
	•	No algorithmic feed
	•	Community governance
	•	Long-term sustainability
	•	Non-extractive alignment

Position as structurally different, not emotionally superior.

9. Announcement & Pinned Post Framing

When creators enable funding:

Recommended messaging includes:
	•	Participation is always free
	•	No ads
	•	No algorithms
	•	Visit link for details

This language reinforces:
	•	Transparency
	•	Voluntary contribution
	•	Infrastructure sustainability

⸻

10. Internal Guardrails for Team

If a feature idea:
	•	Introduces manipulation
	•	Incentivizes engagement metrics

	•	Centralizes control

It must be reviewed against:
	•	Constitution
