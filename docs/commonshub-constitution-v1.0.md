# Preamble: What Commonshub Is

Commonshub provides the means for non-technical individuals, creators, and organizations to spin up, host, and sustain independent social communities using powerful open-source platforms such as Mastodon, Owncast, PeerTube, and related federated tools.

Commonshub is not itself a social network. It is an integration layer, operational scaffold, and stewardship framework that combines:

- Open, federated community software  
- Shared hosting and operational support  
- Integrated funding and payments  
- Governance and stewardship tooling  

The purpose of Commonshub is to make it possible for communities to exist outside advertising-driven, centrally controlled platforms, while remaining financially sustainable, federated, and participant-governed.

Commonshub does not fully control the evolution of the underlying platforms it supports. Instead, it selects, configures, and supports open-source components whose incentives, governance models, and trajectories align with the principles defined below.

---

# I. Core Identity

## 1.1 Not a Social Network

Commonshub does not operate a centralized feed, algorithm, or engagement marketplace.

Communities remain:

- Independent  
- Federated  
- Self-governed  
- Creator-directed  

Commonshub provides infrastructure, not attention manipulation.

---

## 1.2 The Control Plane

Commonshub handles:

- Provisioning
- Hosting
- Payments
- Configuration
- Funding flows
- Governance scaffolding

Conversation and culture live within the supported open platforms.

---

# II. Foundational Principles

## 2.1 Creator Sovereignty

Creators retain authority over:

- Access model (open or gated)
- Funding structure
- Membership requirements
- Moderation standards
- Community norms

Commonshub does not impose a universal business model.

---

## 2.2 Participant Dignity

Participants are not:

- Products
- Engagement metrics
- Ad targets

Participation must be transparent, voluntary, and respectful.

---

## 2.3 Sustainability Without Extraction

Communities should be financially sustainable without:

- Advertising dependency
- Surveillance monetization
- Algorithmic amplification systems

Funding must align incentives between creators and participants.

---

## 2.4 Transparency Over Manipulation

Commonshub forbids:

- Dark patterns
- Hidden billing mechanics
- Artificial scarcity tactics
- Coercive funding language

Clarity is mandatory.

---

# III. Funding Model Principles

## 3.1 Optional Funding (Default Model)

By default:

- Participation is always free.
- Community funding is optional.
- Funding supports sustainability, not access.

Language must clearly state optionality.

---

## 3.2 Creator-Defined Access Models

Creators may choose:

- Fully open communities
- Hybrid models (free + paid tiers)
- Fully gated membership
- Paid access to specific features (e.g., livestreams, video libraries)

Commonshub supports optionality.

Commonshub does not prescribe a universal model.

---

## 3.3 If Access Is Gated

If a creator chooses gated access:

- Access requirements must be explicit.
- Billing must be clearly disclosed.
- No bait-and-switch behavior is allowed.
- Stripe (or payment processor) responsibility must be transparent.

No ambiguity. No hidden walls.

---

# IV. Governance and Moderation Boundaries

## 4.1 Creator Governance

Creators control:

- Community rules
- Enforcement
- Moderation decisions

Commonshub does not moderate community content except where legally required.

---

## 4.2 Platform-Level Intervention

Commonshub may intervene only for:

- Legal compliance
- Infrastructure abuse
- Severe platform-wide risk

Intervention must be:

- Transparent
- Minimal
- Documented

---

# V. Economic Alignment

## 5.1 Incentive Structure

Commonshub revenue must align with:

- Creator success
- Community sustainability
- Platform health

Commonshub must not benefit from:

- Engagement addiction
- Controversy amplification
- Behavioral manipulation

---

## 5.2 No Ad-Based Monetization

Commonshub does not:

- Sell user data
- Inject ads into communities
- Optimize for engagement time

Revenue flows from hosting and creator-aligned funding infrastructure.

---

# VI. Product Design Guardrails

## 6.1 No Algorithmic Feeds

Commonshub must not introduce:

- Engagement ranking systems
- Manipulative feed sorting
- Attention optimization loops

Federated platform defaults apply.

---

## 6.2 Funding Language Standards

Funding copy must:

- Avoid urgency pressure
- Avoid guilt framing
- Avoid hype marketing tone
- Clearly state when participation is free

If gated, copy must clearly state access requirements.

---

# VII. Announcement and Promotion Standards

Creators may promote funding through:

- Platform announcements
- Pinned posts
- Community funding pages

Standard funding announcement format (default open model):

> Support this community if you'd like.  
> Participation is always free. No ads. No algorithms.  
> Visit → example.community/support  

Maximum three lines preferred. No hype. No emojis. No marketing tone.

If gated, language must clearly state membership requirement.

---

# VIII. Architectural Direction

Commonshub supports:

- Mastodon (federated text communities)
- Owncast (live streaming)
- PeerTube (video hosting)
- Future federated tools aligned with these principles

Commonshub remains:

- Modular
- Replaceable
- Open ecosystem-aligned

It does not create proprietary lock-in as a core strategy.

---

# IX. Long-Term Commitment

Commonshub exists to:

- Empower creators with infrastructure previously available only to billionaires
- Enable self-sustaining communities
- Preserve federated independence
- Rebuild digital commons outside advertising dominance

This Constitution defines the boundaries within which Commonshub operates.

All future product decisions must align with these principles.
